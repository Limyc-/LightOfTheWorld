My Ludum Dare 30 submission. Made solo in 48 hours.


Not everyone is as alone as they think.

Goal:

	Steal light from the 3 stars and then find the darkened sun.

Controls:

	WS - Move forward/back
	AD - Rotate left/right
	Esc - Quit game (standalone)

Notes:

	If you get lost, just keep moving around. You'll find your way. The game ends when the camera zooms out.

	I would say this turned out to be less of a game and more of an experience. Just pretend there's life-changing, philosophical text at the end.
